{tlhIngan Hol boQwI'} / Klingon Language Assistant
==================================================
(or: {boQwI'} for short)

tlhIngan Hol boQwI' / Klingon Language Assistant is a lexicon dictionary, canon search tool, and grammar analyser for the Klingon language ({tlhIngan Hol}) devised by Marc Okrand for Star Trek's warrior race, and spoken by characters on The Big Bang Theory and Star Trek: Discovery. It can parse Klingon grammar and serve as an aid in Klingon-to-English translation.  However, it is NOT a general-purpose English-to-Klingon translator.  You will need to know some Klingon already to make use of it for that purpose.

To hear the sounds of Klingon, it is recommended to install the Klingon Text-To-Speech Engine. To analyse sentences from an app such as Duolingo, highlight the Klingon text, then click "share" and select {boQwI'} as the target.

If you encounter any problems, or have any suggestions, there is a link to send me email directly from the menu under "Help".
